The ETL process 
Extraction:
The data extrction part was from API which i used to extract data for each and every continent ,country and city.
  This data is then formatted into json file and saved it in databricks(we can also directly use it for transformation without saving it).
  now the data is ready to be used for transforation as per need.

Transformation:
This part is really challenging as data was having nested json data due to which i had to remove excess columns and extra feilds which is not needed.
The transforamtions depends on the need to business.
  The first task was to remove the Missing Values as from last year there is no case in many countires , So fix those missing values .
  Then, the second one is for finding death rate per country.

Load:
After making trasnformations in it, the final thing is to load it into Amazon S3.
  1.The first thing was making partition on basis of continent.
  2.Saving it in parquet Format For Security.
